### Hangman

- The user is presented with some dashes (these represent letters in a randomly selected word)
- They must guess which letters appear in the word
- A correct guess would display the letter in the word (it is no longer obscured with a dash)
- An incorrect guess means the user loses a life
- The user must guess the word correctly before all of their lives have expired
